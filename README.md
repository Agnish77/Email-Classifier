This project involves analyzing and classifying Yelp reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. Initially, the dataset, containing reviews with star ratings and textual content, was explored to understand the distribution of review lengths and ratings. Visualization techniques, such as count plots and histograms, were used to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics. The reviews were then categorized into 1-star and 5-star ratings, with percentage calculations providing insight into the distribution of extreme ratings. A text cleaning function was implemented to remove punctuation and stopwords, preparing the data for vectorization. Using `CountVectorizer`, the text data was converted into a numerical format, and a Naive Bayes classifier was trained on this data. The model was evaluated using a confusion matrix and classification report, showing high accuracy in predicting review ratings. Further, `TfidfTransformer` was applied to improve feature representation, and the model was retrained and evaluated with a reduced test size, enhancing its performance. The project demonstrated effective text processing and classification techniques, achieving robust results in sentiment analysis of Yelp reviews.
